# Julia implementation of MC-style-vol-eval

A Julia implementation of "Fast Marching-Cubes-Style Volume Evaluation for Level Set Surfaces", Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (https://www.jcgt.org/published/0011/02/02/) Tetsuya Takahashi (Adobe), Christopher Batty (University of Waterloo)

# Usage
Julia code is in fraction.jl file. TODO: Employ metaprogramming for mimicking constant expressions, and implement MC surface area and MS volume/surface algorithms.
